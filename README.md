# The-Music-Shop

### **Microservices project using Java Spring Boot, Docker and Postgres**

<br />

This project has 3 services running individually in 3 seperate Docker containers:

- A music store app (REST API), which allows clients to register and allows customer and stock management.
- A Postegres database to store all the necessary data.
- A rental service, which allows clients to rent vinyls from the music store app.

(Still working on it)
